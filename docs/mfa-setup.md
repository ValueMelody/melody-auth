# Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Setup

MFA adds an extra layer of security on top of your primary sign-in method. Melody Auth supports Email, OTP (TOTP), and SMS MFA, plus related features such as Passkey, Recovery Codes, and Remember Device.

## Configure MFA at the server level

Configure these environment variables in `server/wrangler.toml`:

```toml
# Enforce a specific MFA factor at sign-in
OTP_MFA_IS_REQUIRED=false
EMAIL_MFA_IS_REQUIRED=false # requires email provider configured
SMS_MFA_IS_REQUIRED=false   # requires SMS provider configured

# Enforce enrollment in at least one allowed MFA factor when all *_IS_REQUIRED=false
ENFORCE_ONE_MFA_ENROLLMENT=['otp', 'email'] # options: 'email', 'otp', 'sms'

# Allow Email MFA as backup when the primary factor is unavailable
ALLOW_EMAIL_MFA_AS_BACKUP=true

# Related features
ALLOW_PASSKEY_ENROLLMENT=false   # enable passkey enrollment flows
ENABLE_RECOVERY_CODE=false       # enable recovery codes
ENABLE_MFA_REMEMBER_DEVICE=false # allow users to remember device for 30 days
```

- If any of OTP_MFA_IS_REQUIRED, EMAIL_MFA_IS_REQUIRED, or SMS_MFA_IS_REQUIRED is true, that factor is required at sign-in.
- When all three are false, ENFORCE_ONE_MFA_ENROLLMENT can require users to enroll at least one factor from the allowed list.
- Configure your Email/SMS providers before enabling those MFA types.

## Enrollment options

- Admin Panel: Admins can enroll or unenroll MFA and manage recovery options.
- S2S API: Drive enrollment flows programmatically from your backend.
- Embedded Auth API: Drive enrollment flows programmatically from your frontend.

## Passkey

Passkeys provide secure, phishing-resistant sign-in without passwords and allow users to bypass MFA. Enable enrollment via:

- Enable via ALLOW_PASSKEY_ENROLLMENT=true

## Recovery codes

Recovery codes let users regain access when they forget their password or cannot complete MFA.

- Enable via ENABLE_RECOVERY_CODE=true

## Remember this device (30 days)

Users can choose to bypass MFA on a trusted device for 30 days.

- Enable via ENABLE_MFA_REMEMBER_DEVICE=true

## App-level MFA configuration

Override MFA behavior per application (client) rather than globally.

- Admin Panel: Open the target app and configure MFA requirements (e.g., required factors, email as backup).
- S2S API: Update an appâ€™s MFA configuration programmatically.

This is useful when different apps require different assurance levels (e.g., stricter MFA for internal admin apps). However, it will be conflicting with the ENFORCE_ONE_MFA_ENROLLMENT setting, so you need to carefully consider the impact.
